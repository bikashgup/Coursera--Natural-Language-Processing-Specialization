# Coursera--Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization

There are four courses included in this specialization course. Here, I have  added the asssignments involved in the respective courses. This course helped me to develop my skill in the field of NLP. Through these courses, I have learned a lot of things related to NLP and experienced different projects related to NLP which are mentioned below in the form of assignments.

**NOTE**: 

    Please, do not copy the code if you are performing the assignments realted to any of these courses. You can take references from here but don't copy paste it.

## Courses
 
 Here, the assignemnts in the courses are done in Week wise division. So, in the courses sub-headings you can find the link of the assignments in the week-wise subheadings. The four courses along with the week-wise assignments links are:
